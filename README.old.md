## Installation

### Quick Start (Windows)

1. **Clone or Download** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd quiz
   ```

2. **Run Bootstrap Installer**:
   ```bash
   python bootstrap.py
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Check Python installation (install if needed)
   - Install all dependencies
   - Set up ngrok (optional)
   - Build executable (optional)

3. **Manual Setup** (if bootstrap fails):
   ```bash
   # Install Python 3.8+ if not installed
   # Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   
   # Activate virtual environment (if using venv)
   # Windows PowerShell:
   venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # Windows CMD:
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Manual Installation Steps

1. **Python Requirements**:
   - Python 3.8 or higher
   - pip package manager

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask==3.0.0 pyngrok==6.0.0 pyinstaller==6.3.0
   ```

3. **Configure Ngrok** (Optional but Recommended):
   - Sign up for free at https://ngrok.com/
   - Get your auth token from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
   - Set environment variable:
     ```powershell
     # Windows PowerShell
     $env:NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN = "your_token_here"
     # Or set permanently:
     [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN', 'your_token_here', 'User')
     ```
   - Without token, ngrok works but with 2-hour session limits

   ```bash
   python build.py
   ```
   Executable will be in `dist/QuizBuilder.exe`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your ngrok authentication token (recommended)
  - Without this, ngrok has 2-hour session limits
  - Get free token at: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

### Quiz File Format

Quizzes are stored as JSON in `data/<quiz_name>.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "math_quiz_2024",
  "title": "Math Quiz - Chapter 5",
  "require_full_name": true,
  "timer_minutes": 30,
  "start_message": "Welcome! Read all questions carefully.",
  "end_message": "Thank you for completing the quiz!",
  "shuffle_questions": false,
  "questions": [
    {
      "type": "multiple_choice_single",
      "text": "What is 2 + 2?",
      "weight": 1,
      "options": ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
      "correct_answer": "4"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Check if port 5000 is already in use
- Ensure Flask is installed: `pip install flask`
- Check logs in `logs/` directory

### Ngrok Not Working
- Verify ngrok token is set: `echo $env:NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN` (PowerShell)
- Check internet connection
- Without token, ngrok works but with limitations
- Alternative: Use local network IP for LAN-only access

### Results Not Saving
- Check `results/` directory exists and is writable
- Check disk space
- Review logs for error messages
- Ensure quiz name doesn't contain invalid characters

### Timer Not Syncing
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure server is running
- Try refreshing page (but don't refresh after starting quiz - it will reset)

### Build Errors
- Ensure PyInstaller is installed: `pip install pyinstaller`
- Check Python version (3.8+)
- Try running from command line to see detailed errors

## Security Considerations

- **Local Use Only**: Designed for offline/local network use
- **No Authentication**: Quiz URLs are public - don't share sensitive data
- **Session Tracking**: Prevents same device from submitting twice
- **Server-Side Validation**: All validations enforced on server
- **No Data Collection**: All data stored locally on creator's machine

## Limitations

- Ngrok free tier has limitations (2-hour sessions without auth token)
- Maximum concurrent students depends on local network/server capacity
- No built-in user management or authentication
- Results only stored locally (no cloud sync)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not implemented):
- Cloud result storage
- Student authentication
- Quiz templates and sharing
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile app for quiz creation
- Offline mode for students

## License

This project is provided as-is for educational use. Modify and distribute freely.

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check logs in `logs/` directory
2. Review error messages in GUI/console
3. Verify all dependencies are installed
4. Ensure Python version is 3.8+

## Credits

Built with:
- Python 3
